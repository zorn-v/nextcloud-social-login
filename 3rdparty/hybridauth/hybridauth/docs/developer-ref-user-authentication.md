User Authentication
===================

{% include callout.html content="If you're new to Hybridauth, you may want to start with the [Introduction](introduction.html) to get a general overview of the library and its basic usage. This section will tackle users authentication in more details." type="primary" %} 

### User Authentication:

In the following example we'll demonstrate who to sign a user with Google and how to retrieve his profile using Hybridauth in 4 simple steps. In addition we'll discuss all possible configuration parameters, required or otherwise.

<pre>
/**
* 1. Build the adapter configuration array
*/
$config = [
    /**
    * Required: Callback URL
    *
    * The callback url is the location where a provider (Google in this case) will redirect the use once they
    * authenticate and authorize your application.
    *
    * For this example we choose to come back to this same script, however in your project you'll have to you need to
    * replace it with the valid url to yours. 
    *
    * For convenience, Hybridauth provides an utility function `Hybridauth\HttpClient\Util::getCurrentUrl()` that can
    * generate the current page url for you and you can use it for the callback.
    */
    'callback' => 'http://localhost/path/to/this/script.php',

    /**
    * Required*: Application credentials
    *
    * A set of keys used by providers to identify your website and only required by those using OAuth 1 and OAuth 2. To acquire
    * these you'll have to register an application on provider's site. In the case of Google for instance you can refer to
    * https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849
    */
    'keys' => [ 
        'id'     => 'your-google-client-id',
        'secret' => 'your-google-client-secret' 
    ],

    /**
    * Optional: Custom Scope
    *
    * Providers using OAuth 2 will requires to know the scope of the authorization a user is going to give to your
    * application, and Hybridauth's adapters will request a limited scope by default, however you may specify a custom
    * value to overwrite default ones.
    */
    'scope' => 'profile https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.profile.emails.read', 

    /**
    * Optional: Custom Provider's API end points
    *
    * Hybridauth allows you to overwrite all the provider's API end point, which might be useful in some cases like when
    * there is a need to use a different API version for example.
    */
    'endpoints' => [
        'api_base_url' => 'https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/',
        'authorize_url' => 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth',
        'access_token_url' => 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token',
    ],


    /**
    * Optional: Custom Provider's Authorize Url Parameters
    *
    * Certain providers enables you to customize the authorization url which you can optionality pass in adapter's config
    * as an associative array.
    */
    'authorize_url_parameters' => [
           'approval_prompt' => 'force',
           'access_type'     => 'offline',
           'hd'              => ..,
           'state'           => ..,
           //And so on.
    ],

    /**
    * Optional: Debug Mode
    *
    * The debug mode is set to false by default, however you can rise its level to either 'info', 'debug' or 'error'.
    *
    * debug_mode: false|info|debug|error
    * debug_file: Path to file writeable by the web server. Required if only 'debug_mode' is not false.
    */
    'debug_mode' => false,
    'debug_file' => __FILE__ . '.log',

    /**
    * Optional: CURL Settings
    *
    * For more information, refer to: http://www.php.net/manual/function.curl-setopt.php  
    */
    'curl_options' => [
        //Set a custom certificate
        CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => true,
        CURLOPT_CAINFO         => '/path/to/your/certificate.crt',

        //Set a valid proxy address
        CURLOPT_PROXY          => '8.8.8.8',

        //Set a custom user agent
        CURLOPT_USERAGENT      => 'User Agent String'
        
        //And so on.
    ]
];

/**
* 2. Instantiate Google adapter using the configuration array we built
*/
$adapter = new Hybridauth\Provider\Google($config);

/**
* 3. Sign in a user with Google
*
* Hybridauth will attempt to negotiate with the Google api and authenticate the user. If for whatever reason the process fails,
* Hybridauth will then throw an exception.
*
* Note that if the user is already authenticated, then any subsequent call to this method will be ignored.
*/
$adapter->authenticate();

/**
* Retrieve OAuth 1 / OAuth 2 Access Tokens
*
* These access tokens can be stored to database and later used to restore user's session.
*/
$accessToken = $adapter->getAccessToken();

/**
* 4. Perform actions in behalf of connected user
*
* At this point the authentication process has succeeded, and we can proceed with our application logic. For example we may
* attempt to retrieve the user profile.
*/
$userProfile = $adapter->getUserProfile();
</pre>

### Authenticating User Using Access Tokens

Authenticating a user using access tokens is a similar to normal way of signing in users except for step 3 where we'll feed the adapter the said tokens instead of redirecting the user to provider's website for authentication/authorization.

<pre>
/**
* 1. Build the adapter configuration array
*/
$config = [
    /**
    * Location where to redirect users once they authenticate with Google
    */
    'callback' => 'http://localhost/path/to/this/script.php',

    /**
    * Your Google application credentials
    */
    'keys' => [ 'id' => 'your-google-client-id', 'secret' => 'your-google-client-secret' ],
];

/**
* 2. Instantiate Google adapter using the configuration array we built
*/
$adapter = new Hybridauth\Provider\Google($config);

/**
* 3. Restore OAuth 1 / OAuth 2 Access Tokens
*
* Instead of calling `Adapter::authenticate()` as we'd normally do, here we simply feed the adapter any stored access tokens
* we have. In case the access tokens we used has been revoked or expired, the provider's will reject the connection, and
* Hybridauth will throw an exception.
*
* Note that these tokens should be the same format and content returned by `Adapter::getAccessToken()`
*/
$adapter->setAccessToken($accessToken);

/**
* 4. Perform actions in behalf of connected user
*
* For example we may go ahead and attempt to retrieve the user profile.
*/
$userProfile = $adapter->getUserProfile();
</pre>
