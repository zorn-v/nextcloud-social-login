Details about "Allow login only from specified domain" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)

Custom providers is on your own. Officially not supported

## Config

You can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' => true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.

## Hint

### About Callback(Reply) Url
You can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url!
Some users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.
Please set 'overwriteprotocol' => 'https', in your config.php file.

### Groups
This app also allows the possibility to sync groups to Nextcloud from your OAuth provider. Just provide the following additional payload in your users endpoint:

```json
{
  ** the normal user data
  "data": ["groups": [{"id": 1},{"id": 2}]]
}

```
